# Confidence-Interval-Using-Bootstrapping
Computing the confidence intervals using Bootstrapping. It is very useful when we have to compute the confidence interval for any other statistic(median, std-dev, 95th percentile, etc.) apart from mean(where CLT can be used) given we dont know anything about the underlying distribution of the data.
